# Installs 
In order to use the Folium library efficiently for mapping the team salaries, 2 other libraries need to be installed as well, which are "branca" and "jinja2". In the data preparation for the mapping we also used a Geocoder API to pull lattitudes and longitudes. For the code to run properly, you will need to install geocoder and then sign up for an opencage API key using the link below.

$ pip install folium

$ pip install branca

$ pip install jinja2 

$ pip install geocoder
